\usage{
CreateWalkMatrix(
  inputFileName,
  numCores = 1,
  delta = 0.5,
  zeta = 0.5,
  lambda = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputFileName}{The name of the text file that contains the name of gene
and phenotype data files. Has to be a '.txt' file. This text file is made
from two columns that are tab-separated. the first row needs the two
columns to say type and file_name. Every row after that contains what kind
of data each file would contain. These can be either gene, phenotype, or
bipartite files. Under file_name, you will input the  name of the file
along with the .txt extension. Inside each file_name file, there is a from,
to, and weight column which are all tab-separated. For gene and phenotype
layer files, the from and to columns will have genes and phenotypes, the
order doesnâ€™t matter. The weight column will have the weight of the
relationship of the genes and phenotypes, for unweighted network all
weights must have value of 1. For a bipartite file, the from column must
have genes, the to column must have phenotypes, the meaning and usage of
weight is similar to the gene and phenotype layers.}

\item{numCores}{This is the number of cores used for parallel processing.}

\item{delta}{This is the probability of jumping between gene layers. It has a
range of 0 to 1. It has a default value of 0.5.}

\item{zeta}{This is the probability of jumping between gene layers. It has a
range of 0 to 1. It has a default value of 0.5.}

\item{lambda}{This is the Inter-Network Jump Probability. It has a range of 0
to 1. It has a default value of 0.5.}
}
\value{
This returns a list that contains a walk matrix, list of sorted genes
  by name in the multiplex heterogeneous network, list of phenotypes sorted
  by name in the multiplex heterogeneous networkpool nodes, the degree of all
  genes in the multiplex heterogeneous network to be used for p-value
  generation in randomWalkRestarts method, the degree of all phenotypes in
  the multiplex heterogeneous network to be used for p-value generation in
  randomWalkRestarts method, the number of gene layer files there are, the
  number of phenotype layer files there are, the number of gene pool nodes,
  and the number of phenotype nodes.
